# Rosmarinus

This repo contains our team project for Week 4 of Founders and Coders. 

Rosmarin is a website/widget that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type.
The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values of plant names, leveraging searching and filtering.
A large plant.json file searched through. 

This project is hosted live on : https://rosmarinus.herokuapp.com/

### The Project: Rosmarinus

Aim to make Autocomplete website/widget for plant common names.

Rosmarinus is the latin name for rosemary. 
Rosemary for the plant but also the association with remembrance. 

We used https://trefle.io/ API. It was an easy API to use, one signing up you were given access to a API key. Besides giving us data, it also gave us some design inspiration!

We started off by drawing our software archetecture.

### What did we struggle with?

![cat facedesk](https://media.giphy.com/media/11dR2hEgtN5KoM/giphy.gif)

- Building the different functions in a way that the code is easily read and matainable. 
- explaining the abstractions and modules we build to eachother. 
- restructing the project after it was partially built. 
- group stress levels

### What did we learn?

![node in a nutshell](https://media.giphy.com/media/82CItLnbSh8hzsXK3H/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

* The horror of everything node
* naming is abstraction, naming your functions is understanding them.
* What/ when to modularise. Breaking things up (too much) can spread you too thin.

---

### Stretch goals

* giving you info on the searched plant
* Further CSS styling
* make autocompleted options match the length of input
* give the options additional functionality (buttons).... make them <</li>
* make the options focusable, so show one has been selected.
