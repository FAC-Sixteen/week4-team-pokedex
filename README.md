### The Team

### The Project: Rosmarinus

Aim to make Autocomplete website/widget

A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type.
The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values of plant names, leveraging searching and filtering.
A large plant.json file searched through.

Rosmarinus is the latin name for rosemary. Rosemary for the plant but also the association with remembrance. 

We used https://trefle.io/ API. It was an easy API to use, one signing up you were given access to a API key.

### What did we struggle with?

- Building the different functions in a way that the code is easily read and matainable.
