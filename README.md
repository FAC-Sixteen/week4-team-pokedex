### The Project: Rosmarinus

Aim to make Autocomplete website/widget

A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type.
The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values of plant names, leveraging searching and filtering.
A large plant.json file searched through.

Rosmarinus is the latin name for rosemary. Rosemary for the plant but also the association with remembrance. 

We used https://trefle.io/ API. It was an easy API to use, one signing up you were given access to a API key.

### How to set up our project

That is a work in progress, we deployed a dummy html on heroku.com.

### What did we struggle with?

- Building the different functions in a way that the code is easily read and matainable. 
- explaining the abstractions and modules we build to eachother. 
- restructing the project after it was partial built. 
- group stress levels

### What did we learn?

s simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
